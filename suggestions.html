                                Moments preceding the birth of Naruto Uzumaki, the Kyuubi, a colossal demon with nine
                                tails, launched a
                                devastating attack on the Hidden Leaf Village, Konohagakure. The Fourth Hokage, the
                                village's leader,
                                made the ultimate sacrifice to stop the Kyuubi's ferocious rampage by sealing it within
                                the newborn Naruto.
                                Currently, Naruto is a hyperactive and impulsive ninja residing in Konohagakure. Despite
                                the Kyuubi's presence
                                within him, the village ostracizes him. While striving to establish himself in the
                                community, Naruto's
                                unwavering aspiration to become the Hokage of Konohagakure leads him to both form
                                valuable new friendships
                                and confront dangerous adversaries.

                                    In Alchemy, the Law of Equivalent Exchange restricts the obtaining of something
                                    without an equal loss
                                    of value. Edward and Alphonse Elric become aware of this truth when they try to
                                    practice the forbidden
                                    act of human transmutation. As a consequence of their mistake, Edward loses his left
                                    leg and Alphonse
                                    loses his physical form. Edward sacrifices his right arm to preserve Alphonse's soul
                                    in a suit of armor,
                                    but they are still devastated and alone. Hoping to reclaim their original bodies,
                                    Edward becomes a state
                                    alchemist and acquires "automail" metal limbs. After three years of searching, they
                                    collaborate with
                                    military partners to find the Philosopher's Stone, a mythical object that can defy
                                    the Law of Equivalent
                                    Exchange. As their search reveals a nationwide conspiracy and the dark history of
                                    their country, they are
                                    forced to face the price and implications of their actions.

                                The "Pirate King," Gol D. Roger, was renowned as the mightiest and most infamous sailor
                                to navigate
                                the Grand Line. The World Government's apprehension and subsequent execution of Roger
                                prompted a global
                                shift. His final words disclosed the existence of One Piece, the greatest treasure in
                                the world. As a
                                result, the Grand Age of Pirates emerged, with swashbucklers yearning for One Piece's
                                vast riches, fame,
                                and the vaunted title of Pirate King. Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old atypical pirate,
                                enters the fray.
                                Unlike the stereotypical marauder—grizzled, wicked, and ruthless—Luffy seeks pure
                                adventure, relishing the
                                prospect of meeting diverse characters, embarking on wild escapades, and ultimately
                                obtaining the promised
                                treasure. Inspired by his childhood idol, Luffy and his team navigate the Grand Line,
                                encountering strange
                                phenomena, unraveling enigmatic puzzles, and battling formidable foes in their quest for
                                One Piece, the
                                most coveted of all treasures.

                                (VRMMORPG), has hit the
                                market. It's unique in that players use a device called Nerve Gear to operate their
                                avatars through
                                physical movement. However, the game takes a dark turn when players learn that they
                                cannot exit the game.
                                The creator has taken them hostage and demands that they reach the 100th floor of the
                                tower and defeat the
                                final boss. The catch is that dying in the game means dying in real life. The players
                                are now forced to
                                fight for survival.
