Welcome,

This is my website detailing some of my love for anime and introducing this art form to any potential visitors to my website. On the home page I have displayed a unique image in a common anime/japanese brush style detail and a small intro welcoming visitors to this site. I detail why I built this site and make reference to common geek terminology to welcome similarly like minded people to make them comfortable. At the bottom of this page I have listed two current anime I am watching and a description of each anime for visitors understanding. I have also outlined a reason to sign up to my page and added a link that will open the sign app page for visitors to sign up for a monthly newsletter.

On the next page I have laid out 6 anime I recommend watching, including a description of the anime and reasons to watch at the bottom of this page I have linked a button that will bring visitors to a new web page with a free resource to watch these anime and many more.

On the sign up page there is a form to sign up to a monthly newsletter that once their information has been provided will open an identical page welcoming them to this community and will provide a YouTube video to some anime fight/transition scenes.

BUGS:
I ran into many bugs with my website many of which were related to styling elements correctly or troubleshooting code that did not do what I intended.

Credits:
I took much inspiration from the Love Running project for some design aspects of this website such as the. Nav bar and footer as well as the sign up form design While I made changes to this code for my own design ideas
I used an AI image generator to create several potential pictures including the background images for this website. I used Adobe Firelfy to create these images.
While this website is designed for anime which is already copyritten I used main images for the anime from a website I regularly use called<https://animesuge.to/>  . These images are not my property and are used as a mean to connect site visitors to the respective anime.These images are used for strictly enducational purposes only.
I copied the collapsibleHTML and CSS from https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-collapsible and added it to my site changinga couple of colors and sizes.
